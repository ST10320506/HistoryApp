# HistoryApp - An Easy study tool using flashcards

## Project Overview

The History App, also known as the Flashcard study app, is a native Android application designed to help users study using flashcards. 
Developed in Kotlin using Android Studio, this application helps users test and improve their knowledge across various subjects (history in this scenario) using the flashcard-based quiz method.
Users will be presented with five history-based questions through looped flashcards, scored based on their answers, and receive feedback at the end.

## Problem Statement

Users wanted an app that presents questions through flashcards. Flashcards are a famous study tool used to test a user's knowledge.
This application aims to make studying fun and less stressful as it promotes active recall learning.

## Features

-**User Experience:** Simple navigation through many screens with a clear UI, a personalized welcome message, and scoring uses data passed via 'Intent' Kotlin code.
-**Data Handling:** The history questions and answers are stored in an array for easy iteration. Scoring logic updates as the user answers each question.
-**Fun and Engaging:** Makes studying fun and enjoyable.
-**Kotlin Development:** Built using modern Android development practices with Kotlin.
